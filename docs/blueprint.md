## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep orange (#D45500), echoing Zanzibar's spice colors and warm, inviting atmosphere.
- Background color: Soft beige (#F2E8D0), a light, neutral background that allows furniture to stand out. The hue is similar to the primary color, but very desaturated.
- Accent color: Warm yellow (#E69500), analogous to the primary color but brighter, is for calls to action and highlights.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif, for headlines and short descriptions; body font: 'PT Sans', a modern sans-serif, for body text.
- Clean, minimalist icons for categories, filters, and cart actions.
- Clean and modern layout with a grid system for product listings, image sliders for product details, and a sticky cart for easy access.
- Subtle animations for product loading, cart updates, and transitions.
