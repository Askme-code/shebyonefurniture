    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support the Shaaban Furniture application's features, including product catalog management, order processing, user roles (admin/customer), and personalized style profiles. It emphasizes security, scalability, and debuggability by adhering to the principles of Authorization Independence, Structural Segregation, and Access Modeling.\n\n**Authorization Independence (Denormalization):**\n\n*   **Products:** No authorization context is needed. Products are publicly viewable. Admins manage products through the admin dashboard, and their access is controlled via the `roles_admin` collection. No denormalization needed.\n*   **Orders:** Customer ownership is enforced through the `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}` path. No denormalization is necessary as rules can directly verify that `request.auth.uid == userId`. Admin access is controlled via the `roles_admin` collection, granting them read access to all orders.\n*   **Users:** User roles (`admin` or `customer`) are maintained for admin dashboard access control. The existence of a document `/roles_admin/{userId}` determines admin privileges.\n*   **StyleProfile:** Customer ownership is enforced through the `/users/{userId}/styleProfiles/{styleProfileId}` path. No denormalization is necessary as rules can directly verify that `request.auth.uid == userId`.\n\n**Structural Segregation (Homogeneous Security Posture):**\n\n*   Publicly accessible product data is stored in the `/products` collection. This allows for easy listing and retrieval without complex security rules.\n*   Customer-specific order data is stored under `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}`, providing clear ownership and access control.\n*   Admin privileges are managed through the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection, separate from user profiles, simplifying admin role verification.\n*   User Style Profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}/styleProfiles/{styleProfileId}`, providing clear ownership and access control.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):**\n\n*   The segregation of products into a single `/products` collection enables secure `list` operations for the product catalog. Anyone can list products. Admin access for creation, updates, and deletion will be granted if the user has the `roles_admin` role.\n*   Orders are stored in `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}`, enabling simple, secure rules: only the user with the matching `userId` can list orders under their path. Admins can view all orders due to the `/roles_admin/{userId}` role check.\n\n**Invariants:**\n\n*   Path-based ownership (`/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}` and `/users/{userId}/styleProfiles/{styleProfileId}`) ensures the integrity of order and style profile ownership. The `createdAt` timestamp fields within products and orders can be enforced via rules to ensure their immutability after creation. The admin role check prevents unauthorized modification of product data."
